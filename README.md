## Redux Android

In spite of the repo's name, this is not a Redux implementation. It's an implementation of a design pattern heavily inspired by Elm and Redux ideas.

It's written on Kotlin, and uses Anvil for the UI.

## TODO
- Add explanation to this README.
- Add tests.
- Add more views with an example of navigation.
- Add state logger.
- Add history management.
